        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Boil water.</strong> Different types of tea require
            different water temperature to brew. Check the tea packaging to see
            the recommended water temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Warm up teapot.</strong> This step is a detail that takes
            your tea to the next level and almost no one does it. But they
            should. Take some of the boiled water and fill half the teapot and
            give it a few swirls then throw out the water. We’re warming the
            teapot so that when the hot water for tea goes in, the water
            temperature won’t drop too much.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Put tea into teapot and add hot water.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cover teapot and steep tea.</strong> Set the timer on your
            phone to steep it to the correct amount of time. The steep time is
            different for each kind of tea so check the tea package to see what
            is recommended. Usually it's no more than 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strain tea solids and pour hot tea into tea cups.</strong>
          </li>
